    articleContents: 'The Robin Hood of the art world aka Banksy, Marcel Duchamp,
        Alberto Giacometti, Maud Lewis – these are the heroes of the features and
        documentary films on art topics, that will reach audiences in Tartu at the
        physical event taking place from the 10th until the 15th of August and also
        available online throughout Estonia. The full programme of the 15th Tartu
        Love Film Festival will be announced on the 30th of July.


        According to the new head of the festival Kristiina Reidolv, the topic of
        art is not only relevant in the context of Tartu''s aspirations towards art
        as a city and due to the recent anniversaries – art school Pallas turned 100
        last year and Tartu Art Museum turns 80 this year – but in a wider context.


        "We want to raise art into the societal role as an instigator of social processes
        and as the philosophical trailblazer. Tartu is getting ready to become the
        European Capital of Culture (in 2024) and its banner "The Art of Survival"
        is socially and ecologically more relevant than ever before", she commented.


        The art programme will be opened by the fresh documentary Banksy: Most Wanted
        that has screened only at a handful of times globally after it world premiere
        at the online edition of Tribeca. Aurélia Rouvier''s and Seamus Haley''s film
        is seeking answers to why the world-famous artist won''t reveal his identity,
        creating an extremely engaging portrait of the artist / social warrior.


        In 1964, sculptor Alberto Giacometti (1901-1966) asked critic James Lord to
        pose for him for a portrait. It turned out to be an intense series of 18 meetings,
        during which the critic had a chance to learn about the artistic and emotional
        turmoil of one of the most well-known sculptors of the 20th century. Stanley
        Tucci''s Final Portrait is an insightful depiction of this session, that produced
        the last finished artwork of the artist (played by Geoffrey Rush) who died
        two years later.


        Aisling Walsh''s Maudie is a first deeper introduction into the life of Canadian
        Naïve art painter Maude Lewis (1903-1970), who, despite having her body deformed
        by arthritis, painted, with astonishing enthusiasm flowers, animals and butterlies.
        These paintings covered the house where she lived in poor conditions with
        her husband. Sally Hawkins, who''s made a unforgettable role as Maude, has
        received numerous awards for her role. Her husband is portrayed by Ethan Hawke.


        Marel Duchamp is without doubt one of the most influential modernists and
        artists of the 20th century. Matthew Taylor''s documentary Marcel Duchamp:
        Art of the Possible offers a thorough insight into his legacy and influence
        on the evolution of art, which has been commented on by creative minds such
        as Jeff Koons, Marina Abramović, David Bowie and many others.


        In addition to the film screenings, Tartuff will see a series of art-themed
        events, including exhibitions. performances, symposiums and excursions. The
        programme is organised in cooperation with Tartu Art Museum, Tartu Art College,
        Estonian National Museum, Voronja Gallery, street art festival Stencibility
        and many others.'
